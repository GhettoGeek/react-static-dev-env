# React-Static - Basic Template

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/dalisoft/react-static-dev-env.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

To use this template, run `react-static create` and use the `basic` template.

**Note**: _Installed `react-scripts` as temporarily workaround to pass tests, other way i tried, but didn't worked, i hope and wait tests integration with Jest from `react-static` community_

For more information/docs, please check `react-static` repository
